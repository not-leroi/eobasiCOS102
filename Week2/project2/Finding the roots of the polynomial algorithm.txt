1.Start

2.Ask the user to choose the type of equation:

	.2 for Quadratic (Ax² + Bx + C = 0)

	.3 for Cubic (Ax³ + Bx² + Cx + D = 0)

	.4 for Quartic (Ax⁴ + Bx³ + Cx² + Dx + E = 0)

3.Ask the user to enter the coefficients (A, B, C, etc.).

4. Based on the chosen type:

	If Quadratic, use the quadratic formula to find roots.

	If Cubic, solve using a numerical method like numpy.roots().

	If Quartic, solve using numpy.roots() as well.

5. Display the roots.

6. End.
